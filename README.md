# Code-Optimization-using-AI
## Project Overview
This platform is a comprehensive ecosystem designed not just to optimize code, but to facilitate a deep understanding of software engineering principles. It bridges the gap between Java-based enterprise logic and cutting-edge Generative AI to provide a personalized learning journey.

🌟 Key Pillars
Code Optimization: Instant AI-driven refactoring with a focus on performance and readability.

Learning Engine: Detailed explanations of "The Why"—breaking down Big O complexity and architectural choices.

Gamification: A point-based system with regional leaderboards to drive motivation and peer competition.

Personalized Paths: Tailored challenges based on specific domains like Data Structures (DSA) or Machine Learning.

**##✨ Advanced Features**
📈 1. Learning Journey Tracking
The system maintains a comprehensive history of every code submission.

Quality Metrics: Tracks improvements in time/space complexity and code cleanliness over time.

Progress Visualization: Generates reports for users to see their growth from "Beginner" to "Efficient Developer."

🏆 2. Gamified Achievement System
To add a sense of accomplishment, the platform implements a competitive layer:

Point Allocation: Users earn points based on the difficulty of challenges solved and the efficiency of their code.

Regional Leaderboards: Compare your rank against other developers in your specific region or college.

🎯 3. Domain-Specific Challenges
Users aren't just given random problems. They choose their own focus:

Skill Selection: Choose from categories like DSA, ML Algorithms, System Design, or Web Paradigms.

Smart Referrals: Based on your chosen skill, the AI suggests specific coding challenges designed to strengthen your weak points.

##🛡️ Security & Privacy
Credential Safety: Uses python-dotenv to ensure API keys are never pushed to version control.

Rate Limiting: Implements Slowapi to prevent abuse of the AI endpoints.
